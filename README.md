# Introduction:
Life expectancy

Life expectancy stands for an average life span a person is expected to live in a given set of conditions
It depends on several factors which include social,economical,political and demographic conditions
In the given dataset too we are intended to answer the given questions and building a model which will predict life expectancy by given set of inputs

# Questions:
1. Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect Life 
expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting life expectancy?
2. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare 
expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
3. How do Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
4. Does Life Expectancy has a positive or negative correlation with eating habits, 
lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc?
5. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
6. Does Life Expectancy have a positive or negative relationship with drinking
